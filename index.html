            Rōnin Trail is an open-world adventure game about a wandering 
            samurai searching for his purpose. You play as a survivor of war 
            who must take on odd jobs and bounties to make a living. The game 
            takes place at the start of the Edo period in Japan, shortly after 
            the country was ravaged with war. As you travel through the 
            countryside, chaos persists as disbanded soldiers form violent 
            gangs that terrorize the villagers. It's up to you to bring peace 
            back to the valley.

                Combat is skill-based and fluid. There are many subtle techniques 
            to master in combat. Attack animations are procedurally blended 
            together, allowing for greater flexibility and freedom. As you 
            master the combat system, you'll learn hidden mechanics like 
            sword bashing, back-stepping, and unique sword skills, and stances.
            Each stance has varying attack timings and special attributes which
             you'll learn to utilize in different situations. Every stance has 
             custom-made poses and animations which are based on real life kendo 
             and kenjutsu techniques. As you gain experience, you'll be able to 
             level up your skills to bolster defense or increase dexterity.

                    Fights are brutal and grotesque with blood and dismemberment.
                Straying away from an arcade style of gameplay, Rōnin Trail's 
                combat aims to be realistic. Strikes feel meaty and lethal 
                while the blood interactive system helps to convey a sense of 
                realism. Just as in a real fight, most skirmishes can end in a 
                single strike given the proper timing and distance. The player 
                and foe must be on their toes at all times. One mistake can 
                mean certain death!

                <p>Explore an environment brimming with life. Rōnin Trail features 
                a small but lively open world with a variety of flora and fauna.
                 On your journey, you'll come across various species of 
                 beetles and cicadas in the trees, as well as fish and frogs 
                 in the water. You'll be able to capture unique bugs and 
                 critters with your bug net and fishing pole. A critter 
                 logbook is planned to be added so you can record unique 
                 species you find on your travels.

                         at your side. You'll be able to organize your

                biomes, from misty forests and wind-beaten grasslands to 
                bamboo groves and humid swamps. Visit moss covered shrines 
                or enchanting pagodas hidden deep in the forest. Equip yourself
                 with thicker clothing to survive in the cold as you travel

                    Survive off the land by fishing for trout and foraging for 
                    mushrooms. Combat is not the only brutal part of Rōnin Trail's 
                    world - you'll need to learn to survive on your own. In order to 
                    stave off hunger, you'll have to identify which mushrooms are 
                    edible and find the best spots to fish for trout. You can gather 
                    dry wood in the forest and build a campfire to cook your meals.
                    Your condition affects your aptitude in battle as well. 
                    Hunger will affect your health regeneration while your thirst 
                    affects your stamina recovery. It's important to fuel up before a
                    big fight!

                 Choose-your-own-adventure style of story telling allows you 
                 to choose what side quests and stories to pursue. As a free 
                 spirited ronin, you won't feel bound to follow a single 
                 storyline, rather you'll have the freedom to do whatever 
                 you like—whether it's helping a lost girl find her family 
                 or working with the local militia to drive out encroaching 
                 bandit forces. You can choose to become a cut-throat bounty 
                 hunter or help the village elder find herbs for medicine. 
                 Rise in fame as you slay tougher and more notorious foes. 
                 Be good enough and you might be recruited by an underground 
                 organization of hunters...
